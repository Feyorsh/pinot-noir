* Pinot - Wine wrapper
* Noir - Game launcher
Fetch games list from https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v0002/ with cache TTL of a week or so
Need to be able to search for a game given it's title (using a Vertico completing-read like interface)

The information we need from a game is it's gameid and what platforms it's available on

Written in Go using [[https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea][Charm's Bubble Tea]]

We need to make a Nix expression for Steam's beta client for aarch64-darwin
Noir then needs to automatically startup just the key components of Steam (like the steamapi, the controller api, etc)
Optionally, users can select "Open with steam" which will do "open steam://rungameid/..."

Noir will have "add a game from Steam" or just "add a game", this lets you use Pinot for non-steam games


* TODO Demo
Simple Bubbletea app that reads user input and spits out a gameid
